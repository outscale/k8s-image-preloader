## 🔑 How to use this file

1. During development:
   - Add entries under **[Unreleased]** in the right category.
   - Keep the wording concise and clear.
   - Link related issues/PRs where relevant (`#123`, [PR-456](https://github.com/org/repo/pull/456)).

2. When preparing a release:
   - Move items from **[Unreleased]** into a new version section (`[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`).
   - Leave **[Unreleased]** empty for future changes.

3. At release time:
   - GitHub automatically generates release notes from PR labels (`.github/release.yml`).
   - This `CHANGELOG.md` is the **permanent record** in the repository.
